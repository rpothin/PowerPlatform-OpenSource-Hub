# Power Platform Open-Source Hub Presentation

Accross this section, you will discover a bit more about the Power Platform Open-Source Hub initiative.

## Why this initiative?

During the summer of 2023, I was looking to contribute to open-source projects around Power Platform, but I couldn't find a centralized place that simplified this process or provided assistance.

This lack of resources and support inspired me to start the Power Platform Open-Source Hub initiative.

## The main objective

The goal of this initiative is to create a platform that not only simplifies the process of contributing to open-source projects related to Power Platform but also provides guidance and support to individuals like myself who are passionate about making a difference in this space.

## How it works

1. Every day, a GitHub workflow get details regarding GitHub repositories with at least one of the following topics and store everything into a JSON file

<div align='center'>

2. A series of updates are then made:
    - Sections of the README file are updated to include the latest details regarding the referenced repositories
    - A new version of the website is deployed to include the updated information

You can consider:
- The GitHub workflows as the "engine" of the initiative
- The README file as a summary view of the repositories details
- The website as the "face" of the initiative
