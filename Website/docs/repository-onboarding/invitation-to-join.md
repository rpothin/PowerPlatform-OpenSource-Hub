# Invitation to Join

Thank you for supporting Power Platform open-source projects!

This guide will help you invite the maintainers of your favorite Power Platform open-source projects to join the Power Platform Open-Source Hub initiative.

## Prerequisites

To be able to invite a repository into the initiative, you need to have:
- a GitHub account
- the permission to create issues in it

> Note: If these prerequisites are not achievable for you, you can try to reach out to the maintainers through the contact information available.

## Steps

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Discussions** tab.

> Note: If you don't see the **Discussions** tab, it means that the repository has disabled the issues feature. In this case, if the **Issues** tab is available you can follow a similar approach there and if it is not the case you can try to reach out to the maintainers through the contact information available.

3. Click on the **New discussion** button.
4. Select the best category for your request - _If available, we recommend using the **Ideas** category_.
5. In the **Title** field, add the following: `Invitation to join the Power Platform Open-Source Hub initiative`.
6. In the **Add a body** field, add the following:

```markdown
Hello,

I hope you are doing well.

I am reaching out to you on behalf of the [Power Platform Open-Source Hub](https://rpothin.github.io/PowerPlatform-OpenSource-Hub/) initiative.

The goal of this initiative is to create a centralized place that simplifies the process of contributing to open-source projects related to Power Platform and provides guidance and support to individuals passionate about making a difference in this space.

I believe that your project would be a great addition to this initiative and would love to have you join it.

If you are interested in joining, please check out the [self-onboarding](https://rpothin.github.io/PowerPlatform-OpenSource-Hub/docs/repository-onboarding/self-onboarding) documentation page on the website of the initiative for more information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

> Note: If you have suggestions for the [topics](../intro.md#how-it-works) the maintainers could add to their repository, don't hesitate to add them to the comment.

7. Click on the **Start discussion** button.

That's it for the actions on your side!

Now we will just need to wait for the maintainers to respond to the invitation.
