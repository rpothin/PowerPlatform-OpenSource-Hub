# Self Onboarding

We are thrilled to have you join us!

This guide will help you configure your GitHub repository to be part of the Power Platform Open-Source Hub initiative.

## Prerequisites

To be able to onboard a repository into the initative you need to have the permission to add topics to it.

If you are not the owner of the repository, you can follow the [Invitation to Join](./invitation-to-join.md) procedure and ask the owner to complete the process.

## Steps

1. Select in the list of the monitored topics the one(s) that best describe your repository - _You can find the list of topics [here](../intro.md#how-it-works)._
2. Go to your repository on GitHub.
3. In the **About** section, click on the settings icon.
4. In the **Edit repository details** dialog, add the selected topics to the **Topics** field.
5. Click on **Save changes**.

That's it for the actions on your side!

Now we will just need to wait for a maximum of 24 hours for the repository to be added to the Power Platform Open-Source Hub initative and be visible on the website.
